                <h2>Why FAC?</h2>
                <p>Definitely the people. During my time attending the support group I had the chance not only to
                    experience how peer learning is offered and encouraged, but also to appreciate the support mentors
                    and past members of FAC gave us. I have learnt plenty from other applicants, and I have also had the
                    chance to help and encourage my peers when needed. I don’t think I would have learnt as much as I
                    have in a short period of time if I had to go through this application alone, without being able to
                    discuss ideas, solutions and ask questions. Based on these past months, FAC is the place to be.</p>

                <h2>Why a career in software development?</h2>
                <p>Software development is an ever evolving career, which means continuous learning and development of
                    skills. It seems like there is always something new to learn, which offers the opportunity to grow
                    and keeps your brain challenged, which I find really attractive. I also enjoy the idea of applying
                    my innate creativity to solve problems and help people while working collectively. I found myself
                    performing and enjoying myself more when I have taken part in group projects. I have recently learnt
                    about ways in which coding impacts society and the fact that it can help people’s lives. The chance
                    to work with conscious companies in exciting roles inspired me to pursue this course and career
                    path. And last, I am truly interested in the career opportunities software development is offering,
                    it is an exciting time to be involved in the tech industry!</p>
